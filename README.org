**  Task Manager App
Store your task, on your app!
Custom app used for practicing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database using Atlas.
Tech used:
 - Plain Javascript on frontend with axios api.
 - NodeJS (with dotenv, nodemon, mongoose, and express itself).
 - Express Framework.
 - MongoDB.
The idea of the app, as said, was practice. This has no auth and anyone can tinker it so isn't a good a idea to upload it with a working database and all the show.
**  If you want to test it
1) Make sure you have node and npm installed.
2) Execute on the shell:
   #+begin_src

$ git clone https://github.com/Ee-R/Task-Manager.git
$ cd Task-Manager && echo "MONGO_URI=" >> .env
$ npm install

   #+end_src
3) Set your own MongoDB database with MongoDB Atlas. Go to the Atlas interface. Search your Database.
4) Go to your own cluster and click 'Connect your application'
5) Copy-paste in the '.env' file the connection string like so.
   #+begin_src

    #this should be the .env file
    MONGO_URI=$CONNECTION_STRING_HERE

   #+end_src
6) Execute on the shell:
   #+begin_src
$ npm start
   #+end_src
7) Search on any browser 'localhost:3000/'
